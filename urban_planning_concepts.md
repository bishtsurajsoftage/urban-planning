## Zoning
 - Zoning involves dividing land into different zones or districts with specific regulations for land use, such as residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational zones. This helps to organize and control
   the development of different areas within a city.

## Mixed-Use Development
 - Encourages the integration of different land uses within a single area, promoting a mix of residential, commercial, and recreational activities. This can reduce the need for long commutes and create more
   vibrant, walkable neighbourhoods.

## Density
 - Density refers to the number of people or structures in a given area. Urban planners consider optimal density to balance efficient land use with the need for open space, transportation and infrastructure.

## Smart Growth:
 - Smart growth emphasises sustainable and responsible urban development. It focuses on creating compact, walkable communities with a mix of land uses, efficient transportation options, and a commitment to
   environmental stewardship.

## Transit Oriented Development(TOD):
 - TOD promotes the development of compact, mixed use communities centered around public transportation hubs. This reduces dependence on private cars, encourages walking and cycling, and supports public
   transit infrastructure.

## Green Infrastructure
 - Involves the integration of natural elements, such as parks, green spaces, and sustainable drainage systems, into urban planning. Green infrastructure helps improve environmental quality, provide recreational
   opportunities, and mitigate the impact of climate change.

## Complete Streets:
 - Complete streets are designed to accomodate all users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users, in addition to cars. This concept promotes safety, accessibility and a variety of transportation
   options.

## Placemaking:
 - Focuses on creating places with a strong sense of identity and community.
 - Placemaking involves involving the community in the design process, incorporating local culture and fostering a sense of belonging.

## New Urbanism:
 - A movement that advocates for the design and planning of mixed-use, pedestrian friendly neighbourhoods with a focus on traditional town planning principles. New Urbanism aims to create communities that are
   more sustainable, socially connected, and aesthetically pleasing.


## Resilient Cities:
 - Resilient cities are designed to withstand and recover from various challenges, including environmental disasters, economic downturns, and social disruptions.
